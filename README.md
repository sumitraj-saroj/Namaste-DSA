## 🧠 About This Repository

This repo documents my full journey while learning Data Structures and Algorithms using JavaScript.

Here, I maintain:

- 📚 Topic-wise notes
- 💻 Code implementations
- 🧮 Complexity analysis
- 🧠 Personal learning journal
- 📑 Structured syllabus based on the Namaste DSA course

This will keep growing as I learn more.

## 🧩 Repository Purpose

✔ Build a strong foundation in DSA  
✔ Practice clean, well-written JavaScript implementations  
✔ Develop problem-solving patterns  
✔ Maintain revision friendly notes  
✔ Track my own learning progress  
✔ Prepare for interviews and real-world challenges

## 🧰 What You’ll Find Here

### ✔ Notes

Clear explanations, intuition, derivations, and complexity discussions.

### ✔ Code

JavaScript implementations of:

- classic data structures
- common algorithms
- practice problems

Each solution aims to include:

```js
// Time: O(...), Space: O(...)
// Explanation of approach
// Edge cases
// Alternatives (if any)
```

### ✔ Journal Logs

My ongoing log of:

- what I studied
- what confused me
- mistakes made
- realizations and “aha moments”
- concepts I revisited

## 📑 Planned Topic Roadmap

✔ Warm-up  
✔ Time & Space Complexity  
⬜ Recursion  
⬜ Arrays  
⬜ Strings  
⬜ Searching  
⬜ Sorting  
⬜ Linked List  
⬜ Stack & Queue  
⬜ Recursion + Backtracking  
⬜ Trees  
⬜ Graphs  
⬜ Dynamic Programming  
⬜ Greedy  
⬜ System Design Logic (optional thoughts)  
⬜ Problem Sheets

This will be updated as I progress.

## ✍ Journal Idea

Why a journal?  
Because learning is not just code.  
It’s confusion → clarity → mastery.

My journal will record:

- topics completed
- concepts that were tough
- mistakes I made
- how I corrected them
- breakthroughs
- behavior patterns when stuck

**Example journal entry:**

```
Date: 10 Dec 2025
Topic: Time & Space Complexity
Notes:
- Big O is worst case representation
- Learned how nested loops multiply complexities
- Confused between O(n+m) vs O(max(n,m)) — fixed by reading examples
```
